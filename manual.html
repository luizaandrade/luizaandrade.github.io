            Communication

            - I prefer to communicate verbally
            - I am a type 2 person (ask for things, be prepared to hear no)

            Known issues

            - I have ADHD
            - If something is not in my calendar, I will most likely forget about it
            - I do my best to keep track of tasks and deadlines. But I know that I sometimes forget them don't hesitate to follow up!

            How to work with me if you are my supervisee

            - We will work out a system to track your tasks that work for both of us. I will always add tasks there. I will keep reminding you of what your tasks are or when they are due.
            I expect you to be checking that system and to allocate your time however you prefer. 
            - I am happy to help you prioritize if you don't know what is most important.
            - If you have too much on your plate or something is taking longer than expected, I expect you to let me know in advance. 
            I will try to help and we can redistribute work and so you do not get stuck, but for that I need to know what's going on.
            - Don't hesitate to ask questions. I prefer having too many questions than too few. If I expect you to figure something out on your own, I will tell you that and maybe just send you a link to something.
            But it's not a good use of your time to spend it banging your head against a wall if I can easily turn it into a door.
